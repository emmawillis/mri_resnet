✅ Replaced CrossEntropyLoss with FocalLoss (custom implementation).

✅ Improved 3D augmentation using torchio.

✅ Added WeightedRandomSampler for balanced training batches.



---
switching between predicting either low or high

TRY:
Setting gamma = 0.5 in your FocalLoss

Logging the Counter(labels) from each training batch for a few epochs

Verifying your DataLoader uses sampler=..., not shuffle=True
